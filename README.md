# About Me

Hi, I'm **Gia**! I'm an undergraduate at UC Berkeley crafting my journey towards a physician-scientist career rooted in **neonatology** and maternal–fetal medicine, aiming to bridge **research, clinical experience, and AI-driven technology** constructively to support premature and critically ill kiddos and the families who care for them. 

## Working On...

🫁 _Neonatal Lung Development_ - studying single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data @ **NHBLI + Harvard Medical School** to better understand premature lung injury and repair mechanisms, creating a full stack transcriptome pipeline.

🧬 _Fetal Airway + Lung Organoids_ - helping develop stem-cell–derived models of the fetal airway @ **UC San Diego School of Medicine** to study surfactant biology and viral infection.

👶 _Clinical Learning_ - assisting in NICU and labor + delivery care settings to stay grounded in the realities families experience.

## Previously...

🩸 _Maternal-Fetal & Placental Biology_ - investigated & quanitfied Fe metabolism and infection affects in placental and fetal transmitted disease outcomes @ **UC San Francisco (UCSF)**.

🧪 _Industry-Side Translational Work_ - Prev RA 1 @ **Novome Biotechnologies** | https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8000

## Building...

🚼 _NeoNurture_ - a dual-sided, AI-enabled care-coordination platform for the NICU, providing clinician-reviewed communication workflows and longitudinal, family-facing care-navigation tools.
